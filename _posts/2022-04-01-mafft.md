As far as I know [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) is the only program where one can align short sequences to a big one as a reference without too much trouble. The command to do that is `mafft --addfragments shorties big_one  > result`.

By default MAFFT will put gaps where it can not find a match. To prohibit this behaviour we can increase the penalties for gap opening and extension as this: `mafft --op 10 --ep 10 --addfragments shorties big_one > result`. 

The defaults are:

* --op # :         Gap opening penalty, default: 1.53
* --ep # :         Offset (works like gap extension penalty), default: 0.0

> What are the limits for --op and --ep? I do not know. 15 do the work.
