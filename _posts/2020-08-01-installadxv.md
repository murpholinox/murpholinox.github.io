Adxv can be used to display and analyze 2-D area detector data. It is optimized to display X-Ray crystallography diffraction images.  The data may be displayed as a 1-D cross section,  a 2-D image or a 3-D surface.

From [here](https://www.scripps.edu/tainer/arvai/adxv.html).

I usually download the `adxv.x86_64CentOS7` version. It works fine under Fedora. Just have to download it and move it to `/usr/local/bin`.

Here is an example of what `adxv` can do:
