Here is how to add an `ssh` key to GitHub.

I am too lazy, just follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and then [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

It's easy. 

> Warning: Do not forget your passphrase or you will have to redo everything again (been there :P).
