Here is how to add an SHH key to GitHub.



I am too lazy, just follow instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and then [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

It's easy. Just do not forget your passphrase ... or you will have to redo it (been there).
