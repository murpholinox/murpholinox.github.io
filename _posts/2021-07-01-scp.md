> This works for me and only me. Please scroll to the bottom to find the instructions for you!

## Windows  

1. In Windows you have to download the program `pscp.exe` from [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
![scpwin01]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/scp_win01_cut.png)

2. Then open `cmd` and go to the 'Downloads' folder (or wherever `pscp.exe` was saved).
![scpwin02]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/scp_win02_cut.png)

3. Enter the pscp command like this `pscp prueba123@192.168.1.85:/home/prueba123/clase/* .` and it will ask for a password. Enter the password.
![scpwin03]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/scp_win04_cut.png)


## Fedora & Ubuntu
1. In a fresh F34 installation you only have to do `scp prueba123@192.168.1.85:/home/prueba123/clase/* .`
![scpf34]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/scp_fedora.png)

2. Answer yes to the question and afterwards enter the password.
> Same thing with Ubuntu 20.04.3 (at least in the normal installation mode).

## Instructions for you!
Just change the ip address from '192.168.1.85' to '187.226.92.54', everything else is the same...

> Update: This is no longer required as 'normal' people tend to use 'easier' ways. At least that is what they say.
