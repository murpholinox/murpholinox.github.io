## Windows 

1. In Windows you have to download the program `pscp.exe` from [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

2. Then open `cmd` and go to the 'Downloads' folder (or wherever `pscp.exe` was saved).

2. Enter the pscp command like this `pscp prueba123@192.168.1.85:/home/prueba123/clase/* .` and it will ask for a password. Enter the password.
