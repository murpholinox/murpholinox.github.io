When the same code in the same system gives you different results.

The proof:

 ![aria2c]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/aria2c.png)

On the right hand side is Fedora 34 running in `gnome-boxes` and on the left hand side is Fedora 34. The version of `aria2c` is the same in both terminals. 

By the way, that line is supposed to make `aria2c`  to seed for one minute, not a nice thing to do, after download is complete and exit `aria2c` automatically.
