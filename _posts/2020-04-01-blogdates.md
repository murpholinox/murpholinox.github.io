The observant reader might already know that the entries in this blog have as a date the first day for all months for the last three years. That is just a consequence of the way we have to name files in `jekyll`, so that `jekyll` recognizes them as 'blog entries'. Any date is fine, but a date must be supplied to `jekyll`. So, I chose the first day for each month for the last three years, only because I have about approximately 25 notes and setting up the filenames is easier that way. Actual dates are probably a lot more different, ...  although I tried my best.
