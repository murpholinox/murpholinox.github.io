[Here](https://www.latextemplates.com/) you can find `LaTex` templates. I usually choose [this](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/focus-presentation) for my talks. There is also a nice collection of templates in the 'Academic Journals' section. In the 'Miscellaneous' section there is the template for the `bash` cheatsheet that is [here]({% post_url 2020-01-01-bashshortcuts %}).  In the 'Theses' section you can find the template for the [classic-thesis](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/classicthesis-typographic-thesis), which I used for my master's [degree](https://github.com/murpholinox/tesis_maestria). 

> Update: home page of the `classic-thesis` package is [here](https://bitbucket.org/amiede/classicthesis/wiki/Home).

I recently find `Kaobook` which is a nice `LaTex` template for books and thesis. You can find it [here](https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook). If you want to use it with `TexLive` integration follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook/tree/master/instructions/texlive_integration). I think I am gonna use this template for my PhD's thesis.
