A few days ago I went to LANEM which means Laboratorio Nacional de Estructura de Macromol√©culas. If you google 'LANEM' you get links from [UNAM](https://iquimica.unam.mx/servicios-iq/laboratorios-nacionales/lanem-iq) and [UAEM](https://www.ciquaem.mx/lanem). So... that's a bit odd, but after reading a while you get to realize that one part is at the UNAM (XRC) and the other part at the UAEM (NMR). 

The X-ray generator at LANEM-IQ is a Microfocus rotating anode X-ray generator. [Here](https://www.rigaku.com/products/sources/mm007) you can learn a little bit more about that apparatus. It is very sad that no one can give you a value for the [spectral brightness](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1107/S090904950500796X). Maybe the guys at rigaku can do that.
