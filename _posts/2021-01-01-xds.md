To install XDS in Fedora just read the instructions [here](https://xds.mr.mpg.de/html_doc/downloading.html). Is not difficult.

1. Download XDS-INTEL64_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
2. Do 
``` bash
cd ~/Downloads
tar xvzf XDS-INTEL64_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
cd
echo "#XDS" >> .bashrc
echo "export PATH=/home/`whoami`/Downloads/XDS-INTEL64_Linux_x86_64:$PATH" >> .bashrc
echo "export KMP_STACKSIZE=8m" >> .bashrc
```
That's it.
